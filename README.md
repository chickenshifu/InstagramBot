**Python tool to automate Follower growth through liking/following on Instagram**


## How to use?

1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed both [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). You donâ€™t need to install for instance Python, as both are provided by Docker images.

2. Open Terminal and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Bugs? Issues? Not Working?
As this automation tool is based on selenium, it can at any time be the case, that certain the script get broke due to changes on the front end of Instagram webapp. Those minor changes in the DOM can be easily fixed. 

Just drop an issue, I'll try to fix it as fast as I can.
